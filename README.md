# Scraper 27 from [Scraping for Journalists](https://leanpub.com/scrapingforjournalists/): Scraping Excel spreadsheets part 1

This scraper includes some lines which are 'commented out' so that they don't run. You can uncomment those (delete the hash symbol) to make the scraper work with one of two different URLs, and/or run a different regular expression (regex).

This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation)
